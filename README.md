# SCI Stars

> **SCI Stars** is a cross-platform Battle Royale game that blends competitive multiplayer action with effective preparation for Polish IT professional exams (INF.02, INF.03, INF.04). Our mission — make learning fun and accessible – while capturing the spirit of life at our beloved Technikum Informatyczne SCI!

## :video_game: Game Overview

SCI Stars is not your typical battle royale. Here, up to **8 players** face off in an arena, each controlling a unique character inspired by real teachers from our school – adding a humorous and motivating twist to the competition! But victory isn’t just about reflexes and tactics — it’s also about knowledge.

### :brain: Learning Through Play

- **Exam Questions on the Battlefield.**
    At the beginning of every match, special **holograms** spawn in various locations. Destroying a hologram triggers an *exam-style question* (from INF.02, INF.03, or INF.04).
    - **Answer correctly** – your character’s damage and max health increase!
    - **Answer incorrectly** *(or run out of time)* – all your living opponents receive the stat boost instead.

- **Fight, Learn, Repeat!**
    The last player standing wins the round, but everyone walks away a little more prepared for their exam.

### :moneybag: In-Game Economy

- **Win Battles, Earn Plugs** – Victories grant you **plugs** (our in-game currency).
- **Unlock Loot Boxes** – Use plugs to open **loot boxes** containing a random amount of coins.
- **Upgrade Your Characters** – Spend coins to upgrade your characters’ stats – *health* and *damage* – giving you an edge in future battles. (The higher the upgrade, the more coins it costs.)

### :school: SCI School Vibes

Every character is a playful parody of **a real SCI teacher**, making matches feel like a crazy, metaphorical journey through daily life at our technical school.
